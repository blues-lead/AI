# The first exercise set

The main file we were working on is 'search.py'. There we must implement
four two algorithms:
* Depth-First search (DFS)
* Breadth-First search (BFS)
* Unified cost search (UCS)
* A\*

The DFS was implemented using stack (LIFO) as structure, wich memorises nodes
to be visited and the visitation order.
The BFS has the same implementation with one distinction in structure for nodes to be visited.
BFS uses stack (FIFO)
The UCS and A\* algorithms uses cumulative sums of path costs and as a data structure is used priority queue.
